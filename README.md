# Fixed Point Solution of Single Particle Schr√∂dinger Equation in Finite Difference Form

Additional information and the Python code for the paper of the same title.

In this paper, I have introduced a simple fixed point map method for the numerical
solution of the Schrodinger equation in finite difference form in arbitrary dimensions.
The fixed point yields the real solutions of the single particle Schrodinger equation and
therefore, aptly suited for computing the ground state solutions of that equation.

The plots are not made with Python, but with an open source software called Veusz.
Plot files and further details are available upon reasonable request.

	the 3D probability amplitude for 102\(^3\) (1,061,208) grid points, b) probability amplitude
	along the X direction, c) XY plane slice of the 3D probability amplitude for
	302\(^3\) (27,543,608) grid points, d) probability amplitude along the X direction. The
	dotted blue line shows the probability amplitude of the ground state of the free hydrogen
	atom for comparison.

  <figcaption>Benchmarking the hydrogen atom solution in a 10 Bohr $\times$ 10 Bohr
  $\times$ 10 Bohr box: a) log(Computational Time) vs. log(Total Number of Voxels) shows
  two distinct regimes. For smaller $N$, it scales as $O(N^{0.63})$, and for larger $N$,
  it scales as $O(N^{1.4})$, which is a considerable improvement over the typical $O(N^3)$
  behavior expected in finite difference methods, b) Plot of the ground state energy
  vs. log(total number of voxels). The dotted line is an exponential fit, which produces
  an excellent fit to the data, giving the limiting energy value of -0.997495 Ry.

  <figcaption>Hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field in the negative \textit{x}
  direction. Physical dimensions of the box are similar to the rest of the plots: a)
  Hydrogen atom plus a potential term $-0.08x$ Ry. The probability amplitude shows an
  expected displacement of the electron cloud in the opposite direction to the applied
  field, b) same as a) with contours to better show the distortion in the probability
  amplitude, c) Hydrogen atom plus a potential term $-0.15x$ Ry, d) same as c) with
  contours to better show the distortion in the probability amplitude.

  in the box, c) 0.101 Debye dipole moment showing the ground state with energy 0.912737

  of the wavefunction in the box.
