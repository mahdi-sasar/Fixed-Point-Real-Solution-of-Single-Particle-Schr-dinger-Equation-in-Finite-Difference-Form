# Fixed Point Solution of Single Particle Schr√∂dinger Equation in Finite Difference Form

Additional information and the Python code for the paper of the same title.

In this paper, I have introduced a simple fixed point map method for the numerical
solution of the Schrodinger equation in finite difference form in arbitrary dimensions.
The fixed point yields the real solutions of the single particle Schrodinger equation and
therefore, aptly suited for computing the ground state solutions of that equation.

atom for comparison.</figcaption>
