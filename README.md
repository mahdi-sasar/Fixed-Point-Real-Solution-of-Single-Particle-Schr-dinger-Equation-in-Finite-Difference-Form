# Fixed Point Solution of Single Particle Schr√∂dinger Equation in Finite Difference Form

Additional information and the Python code for the paper of the same title.

In this paper, I have introduced a simple fixed point map method for the numerical
solution of the Schrodinger equation in finite difference form in arbitrary dimensions.
The fixed point yields the real solutions of the single particle Schrodinger equation and
therefore, aptly suited for computing the ground state solutions of that equation.

  <figcaption>Benchmarking the hydrogen atom solution in a 10 Bohr $\times$ 10 Bohr $\times$ 10 Bohr box: a) log(Computational Time) vs. log(Total Number of Voxels) shows two distinct regimes. For smaller $N$, it scales as $O(N^{0.63})$, and for larger $N$, it scales as $O(N^{1.4})$, which is a considerable improvement over the typical $O(N^3)$ behavior expected in finite difference methods, b) Plot of the ground state energy vs. log(total number of voxels). The dotted line is an exponential fit, which produces an excellent fit to the data, giving the limiting energy value of -0.997495 Ry.</figcaption>
